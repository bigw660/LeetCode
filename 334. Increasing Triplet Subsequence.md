class Solution:
    def increasingTriplet(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if not nums or len(nums) < 3:
            return
        # basic idea: when the current element <= max of previous elements, we need to update the subsequence,
        # keep all elements of the subsequence as small as possible.
        
        # step : once we find a valid triplet, done
        # continue update the first and the second smallest elements
        # we can make sure first < second and if we can find third < second, then done!
        subsequence = [inf, inf]
        for i in nums:
            if i <= subsequence[0]:
                subsequence[0] = i
            elif i <= subsequence[1]:
                subsequence[1] = i
