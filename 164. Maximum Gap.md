# basic approach:
class Solution:
    def maximumGap(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return 0
        nums = sorted(nums)
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            res = max(res, nums[i] - nums[i-1])
        return res

# optimal approach:
```
1. We choose a bucket size bb such that 1 < b \leq (max - min)/(n-1)1<b≤(max−min)/(n−1). Let's just choose b = \lfloor (max - min)/(n-1) \rfloorb=⌊(max−min)/(n−1)⌋.
2. Thus all the nn elements would be divided among k = \lceil (max - min)/b \rceilk=⌈(max−min)/b⌉ buckets.
3. Hence the i^{th}i th bucket would hold the range of values: \bigg [min + (i-1) * b, \space min + i*b \bigg )[min+(i−1)∗b, min+i∗b) (1-based indexing).
4. It is trivial to calculate the index of the bucket to which a particular element belongs. That is given by \lfloor (num - min)/b \rfloor⌊(num−min)/b⌋ (0-based indexing) where numnum is the element in question.
5. Once all nn elements have been distributed, we compare k-1k−1 adjacent bucket pairs to find the maximum gap.
