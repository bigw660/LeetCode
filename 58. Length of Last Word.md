```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        # This is a tricky quesiton! We need to split the string before checking the length. Why?
        # Because the input string colud be "    " -> with many empty space.
        # For such case, len(s) != 0 but s.split() == 0. That's why we will have Index out of range error.
        return len(s.split()[-1]) if s.split() else 0
